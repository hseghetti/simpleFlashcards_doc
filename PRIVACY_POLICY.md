## Simple Flash Cards: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Simple Flash Cards App

The App was develop to help our own kids to learn new words in English and Spanish. We take privacy very seriously.
The app does not collect any data without your knowledge.

We hereby state, to the best of we knowledge and belief, that we have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
We don't store data on your device.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app:


<br/>

| :---: | --- |
| `userTrackingPermission` | This identifier will be used to deliver personalized ads to you |

### We use Goggle AdMob as ads provider. 
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.

### Data collected and shared automatically

The Google Mobile Ads SDK collects and shares the following data types automatically for advertising, analytics, and fraud prevention purposes.

Data	By default, the Google Mobile Ads SDK...
IP address	Collects device's IP address, which may be used to estimate the general location of a device.
User product interactions	Collects user product interactions and interaction information, including app launch, taps, and video views.
Diagnostic information	Collects information related to the performance of your app and the SDK, including crash logs, app launch time, hang rate, and energy usage.
Device and Account identifiers	Collects Android advertising (ad) ID, app set ID, and, if applicable, other identifiers related to signed-in accounts on the device.
All of the user data collected by Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

### Data handling

Android ad ID collection is optional. The ad ID can be reset or deleted by users using ad ID controls in the Android settings menu. As the app developer, you can prevent the collection of ad IDs by updating the app's manifest file.

Certain other features in the Google Mobile Ads SDK, such as the Limited Ads feature, may also disable transmission of the ad ID and other data.

Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:

- Reset your device’s advertising ID, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
- Delete your device’s advertising ID, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by our development, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
