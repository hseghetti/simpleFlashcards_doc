## Simple Flash Cards: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Simple Flash Cards App

The App was develop to help our own kids to learn new words in English and Spanish. We take privacy very seriously.
The app does not collect any data without your knowledge.

We hereby state, to the best of we knowledge and belief, that we have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
We don't store data on your device.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app:


<br/>

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |

We use Goggle AdMob as ads provider. 
Advertising identifiers for mobile apps
To serve ads in services where cookie technology may not be available (for example, in mobile applications), we may use technologies that perform similar functions to cookies. Sometimes Google links the identifier used for advertising on mobile applications to an advertising cookie on the same device in order to coordinate ads across your mobile apps and mobile browser. This can happen, for example, when you see an ad within an app that launches a web page in your mobile browser. This also helps us improve the reports we give to our advertisers on the effectiveness of their campaigns.

Ads you see on your device may be personalized based on its Advertising ID. On Android devices, you can:

- Reset your device’s advertising ID, which replaces the current ID with a new one. Apps can still show you personalized ads, but for a while they may not be as relevant or interesting to you.
- Delete your device’s advertising ID, which deletes the advertising ID and doesn't assign a new one. Apps can still show you ads, but they may not be as relevant or interesting to you. You won't see ads based on this advertising ID, but you may still see ads based on other factors, like the information you’ve shared with apps.


If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by our development, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
